# Landslide-Monitoring
Project for analysing Landslide by using various data from satellites
the repository contains details for creating an ANN project for data analysis and formulation of regions prone to landslide
the data given is owned by zeta space.

File_Analysis.py
-----------------

this code is used to get the information from satellite seperated from any type of file irrespective of extension. even works on .zip file. 

this file can be used to collect data from satellite and donot need manual unziping or extraction. If it can be automated we can use the code to analyse data in real time.

the codes and libraries are simplified and modularised for better understanding and codes and their uses are given on the code as comments.
